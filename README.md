# Metrans intro task

This project is just small task to prove skills. The task was:

- To create table showing data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
- To convert user ID values to string (1 = admin, 2 = tester, default = unknown)
- Add CRUD operations (add/edit/delete)
- Allow to sort by title column
- Comment the code well

## Solution details

- Standard TypeScript/React/Vite project template was used
- You can find the app logic in App.tsx
- Solution fetches the JSON from specified URL.
- Solution implements modal window for editing and in row controls for adding record.
- Solution validates the input of add/edit operations
- Deleting row requires the confirmation
- Sorting is implemented for title column as requested
- Extra work was done to make everything nice looking

## Git usage note

- Typically, I use different branch for changes before merging/commiting the code to master, however, this is just a small task.
